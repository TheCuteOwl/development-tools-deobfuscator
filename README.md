<p align="center"><strong><i>⚠️ HOW TO USE IT :</i></strong</p>
<br><br>

* How to use it :
  * Open obfuscated.txt and replace everything with the obfuscated script you want to deobfuscate
  * You need to modify this 
  `magic = 'cHJpbn'`
`love = 'DbW3Il'`
`god = 'IHNleH'`
`destiny = 'xaXD=='`  With your script
 
 * Now launch main.py 
 
 * It will decompiled it and write the deobfuscate code in deobfuscated.txt
 
 * Like the obfuscated stuff in my program will give you print('ur sexy')
 
 
 ** OLD VERSION IF PROBLEM **
 
 * Modify the program with any IDE : Notepad, Notepad++, VScode or other
 
 modify
   `magic = 'cHJpbn'`
`love = 'DbW3Il'`
`god = 'IHNleH'`
`destiny = 'xaXD=='

with your  obfuscated script and start main.py
